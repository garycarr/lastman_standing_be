# lastman_standing_be

## Get started
Mongodb needs to be running on the machine
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This is a work in progress, mainly a quick backend for https://github.com/garycarr/lastman_standing_fe.
One day it will have tests and proper structuring.

Also TODO - docker with the front end.
